# Competitive analysis: Resume builders (2025)

This snapshot compares leading resume builders to inform our redesign. Benchmarked apps: Canva (Resume), Novorésumé, Resume.io, Zety, Enhancv.

## Summary insights
- Onboarding and first win: Top tools push users into a guided wizard and show an instant preview with a sensible template preselected.
- AI everywhere: Headline, bullets, summaries, tone control, and job-tailoring are integrated inline, not as a separate step.
- ATS readiness: Most expose ATS-friendly templates, keyword checks, and scorecards; some run real-time validations (length, buzzwords, tense).
- Content library: Reusable sections, pre-written bullet banks by role/industry, and multi-language support.
- Portfolio/cover letter: Integrated cover letters and simple personal sites are common upsells.
- Pricing: Free tier to build; export to PDF/Word and advanced templates are paywalled. Monthly plans ~$2.95–$24.95, annual effective $3–$9/mo.

## Feature matrix (condensed)
- Templates: Canva, Resume.io, Zety, Enhancv all offer 20–100+ modern templates with variations; ATS-safe indicated.
- AI assistance: All support AI bullet/summary; Enhancv and Zety offer tone and impact tuning; Resume.io offers job-tailored suggestions.
- Import: PDF/Word import with variable accuracy; LinkedIn import common (Novorésumé, Resume.io).
- Sections: Rich section library, custom sections, ordering, duplicates (e.g., multiple experiences/skills groups).
- Checks: ATS keywords, grammar, readability, length warnings, banned elements (tables, graphics) for ATS-safe flow.
- Exports: PDF/Word; some offer PNG; shareable links with privacy settings.
- Job tools: Boards or integrations; trackers; auto-fill to popular ATS forms via browser extension (Zety-like); alerts.
- Collaboration: Commenting and share-for-review rare; team plans exist for campus/career centers.
- Analytics: Basic views/downloads metrics for shared links; template performance (admin side).

## Gaps and opportunities
- Inline AI as a copilot: Keep the user in the editor with contextual actions (improve bullet, quantify, tailor to job post) rather than jumping between screens.
- ATS optimization as real-time linting: A right-rail checklist with actionable fixes and keyword coverage vs job description.
- Multi-profile library: Multiple role-targeted versions with shared content blocks; quickly switch goal and re-tailor.
- Portfolio builder and public profile: Lightweight personal site autogenerated from resume blocks.
- Collaboration and review: Share with mentors/recruiters for comments; suggestions mode.
